# GeneralSocialSurvey
This repository looks at data from the [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/) (GSS) 

<b>About the GSS</b> (from their website):

<blockquote>For five decades, the General Social Survey (GSS) has studied the growing complexity of American society. It is the only full-probability, personal-interview survey designed to monitor changes in both social characteristics and attitudes currently being conducted in the United States.</blockquote>

There are over 4000 variables in this survey and the codebook is over 600 pages long. The initial goal of this repository is to create some impactful social data visualizations with Seaborn - as our familiarity with the dataset increases, the plan is to allow the notebooks to evolve into more robust data storylines.

The basic approach to cleaning GSS data comes from [AllenDowney/PoliticalAlignmentCaseStudy](https://github.com/AllenDowney/PoliticalAlignmentCaseStudy). If you like what he has done, go buy one of his books to show your appreciation!

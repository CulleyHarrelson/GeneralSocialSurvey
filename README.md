# GeneralSocialSurvey
This repository looks at data from the [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/) (GSS) 

**About the GSS** (from their website):


> The General Social Survey (GSS) is a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States conducted since 1972. The GSS collects data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends in opinions, attitudes and behaviors. The GSS has adapted questions from earlier surveys, thereby allowing researchers to conduct comparisons for up to 80 years.
>
> The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.
>
> Altogether, the GSS is the single best source for sociological and attitudinal trend data covering the United States. It allows researchers to examine the structure and functioning of society in general, as well as the role played by relevant subgroups and to compare the United States to other nations.


There are over 4000 variables in this survey and the codebook is over 600 pages long. The initial goal of this repository is to create some impactful social data visualizations with Seaborn - as our familiarity with the dataset increases, the plan is to allow the notebooks to evolve into more robust data storylines.

The basic approach to cleaning GSS data comes from [AllenDowney/PoliticalAlignmentCaseStudy](https://github.com/AllenDowney/PoliticalAlignmentCaseStudy). If you like what he has done, go buy one of his books to show your appreciation!

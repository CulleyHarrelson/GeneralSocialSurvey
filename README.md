# GeneralSocialSurvey
This repository looks at data from the [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/) (GSS) 

The basic approach to cleaning GSS data comes from [AllenDowney/PoliticalAlignmentCaseStudy](https://github.com/AllenDowney/PoliticalAlignmentCaseStudy). If you like what he has done, go buy one of his books to show your appreciation!

<b>About the GSS</b> (from their website):

<blockquote>For five decades, the General Social Survey (GSS) has studied the growing complexity of American society. It is the only full-probability, personal-interview survey designed to monitor changes in both social characteristics and attitudes currently being conducted in the United States.</blockquote>
